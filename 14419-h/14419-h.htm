    <h3>HISTORICAL.</h3>

    <p>This tongue was spoken in the middle of the last century
    over a region of country principally within Sonora, the
    northernmost of the seven Provinces then comprising the kingdom
    of New Galicia under the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The limit of
    Sonora on the east was continuous along the chain of mountains
    that divides it from Taraumara,—from Sateche, the farthest of
    the Indian settlements in that district, southwardly eighty
    leagues to Bacoa Sati the first of its towns. On the west the
    Province was washed by the sea of Cortez from the mouth of the
    Hiaqui to the Tomosatzi, or Colorado, the waters of the Hiaqui
    forming its limit to the south; and on the north by a course
    from the Mission of Baseraca westwardly through the Presidio de
    Fronteras to that of Pitic (Terrenate), a distance of seventy
    leagues. According to the opinion of a Jesuit Father, the
    author of an anonymous work in manuscript on that country,
    written in the year 1762 at Alamo, it was thought also to be
    the most important among the many Provinces of Mexico, whether
    for fertility of soil, gold washings, or silver mines; and not
    less distinguishable for the docility and loyalty of those
    aboriginal inhabitants who had early given their adhesion to
    the government to secure religious instruction.</p>

    <p>The Missions of Sonora included moreover a section to the
    south bounded by the River Chico within the Province of
    Ostimuri. To the north, within the religious precinct, was the
    Pimeria Alta through the Sobahipuris up to the junction of the
    river of that name, (otherwise the San Pedro,) with the Gila;
    thence for a distance of more than one hundred and thirty
    leagues, after passing <!-- page 6 -->
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"
       id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> among <i>rancherias</i> of
       Pima, Opa, and Cocomaricopa, and having received in its
       course the Asumpcion, or Compuesto—from its being formed by
       the united waters of two streams, the Salado and Verde—it
       enters the Tomosatzi, closing that Pimeria of innumerable
       tribes described by the missionaries as sealed in productive
       places, and in a genial climate. Other Indians of the same
       names, the Yuma also and Papapootam (Papago) lived beyond,
       as appears from the accounts given by the spiritual invaders
       of those remote regions, chiefly the Fathers Kino, Keller,
       and Sedelmayer.</p>

    <p>The two principal nations of Sonora are spoken of as the
    Opata and Pima, since the Eudeve should be reckoned with the
    Opata, for the reason that its language differs as little from
    that of the other as the Portuguese from the Castilian, or the
    Provençal from the French; and likewise should also be added
    the Jove, who, having mingled with the Opata, no longer use
    their own tongue, except in some instances of the aged. It is
    one difficult to acquire, and different from any other in the
    Province.</p>

    <p>The Opata are the best of the native Christians, having
    never turned upon their teachers, nor once risen against the
    royal authorities; nor do they, like other Indians, make the
    women bear the heavier share of the labor in the fields. They
    are industrious husbandmen; but they are not any the less
    wanting in valor on that account, having oftentimes shown their
    good conduct when bearing arms with the king’s forces at the
    expense of the Missions. Individuals there were, and perhaps
    still are, who did the work of blacksmiths, carpenters,
    tailors, stone cutters, masons, learning any craft readily, and
    practicing it with skill. They and some of the Endeve, although
    in a less degree, are to the other Indians what the people who
    live in towns are to those in the country, still for all it was
    remarked, they were none the less Indians. Such was the general
    character of the Opata, which is the same that is given of them
    in our time by that curious and instructive observer, John R.
    Bartlett, in his narrative of an expedition into that
    country.</p>

    <p>The Jove were a rural people, quite the greater number of
    them, unwilling to be brought together in communities, lived in
    chasms among the ridges where they were born, proof to the
    solicitations of kindness and conveniences of civilized life.
    The other portion of them dwelt in Ponida, Teopari and Mochoba.
    The good missionary at Bacadeque endeavored to bring into towns
    those who inhabited the rancheria <!-- as above --> of Sathechi
    and the margins of the Mulatos and Arcos, rivers to the south,
    without avail. They live among briars, owning a few animals,
    subsisting on wild fruits and vegetables, gathering an
    occasional stalk of maize or a pumpkin that nature suffers to
    grow in some crevice here and there made by torrents bursting
    from the mountains.</p>

    <p>These nations, the Pima and the Opata, Eudeve, Jove, forming
    two people, occupy the greater portion of Sonora, seated far
    inward to the west from the Cordillera. The limit on the south
    is where stood the deserted town of Ivatora thence to Arivetze,
    Bacanora, Tonitzi, Soyopa, Nacori; on the west from Alamos,
    through parts of Ures and Nacomeri to Opedepe, and Cucurpe; on
    the north from Arispe, Chinapa, Bacoquetzi, Cuquiaratzi to
    Babispe, and from that Mission of Babispe on the east by
    mountains of low elevation returning to Natora.</p>

    <p>The Pima occupy a still wider territory, extending on the
    south into Cinaloa, on the east in to the Province of
    Taraumara. The Upper Pima are found far to the north
    <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"
       id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span> living by the Sobahipuris to
       its outlet, and on both banks of the Gila to the Tomosatzi,
       in vales of luxuriant beauty, and in wastes of sand and
       sterility between those rivers and the sea,—having still
       other tribes beyond them using the same language in
       different dialects. The Lower Pima are in the west of the
       Province, having many towns extending to the frontier of the
       indomitable Seri, who live some thirty leagues to the north
       of the mouth of the Hiaqui and have their farthest limit
       inland, some dozen leagues from the sea, finding shelter
       among the ridges, and in the neighboring island of
       Tiburon.<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
       Those of the Pima who reside on the south, in the Province
       of Cinaloa, the history of their migration thither is of the
       earliest, and belongs to that which should relate the
       closing scene in the journey of Cabeza de Vaca, with the
       strange success that eventually, at the close of a century,
       attended his Christian purpose.</p>

    <p>All these nations, save the last, and all others who inhabit
    the country excepting the Apaches—including a numerous people
    on the Gila and on the farther bank of the Colorado—speak the
    same language, with so slight differences, say the
    missionaries, that they who shall have attained the one of the
    Opata and Eudeve with little difficulty will master the rest.
    And for this we have that early authority referred to, of three
    centuries since: “They made known to us what they would say by
    means of a language they have among them through which we and
    they understood each other. Those to whom it properly belongs
    we call Primahaitu, which is equivalent to when we say
    Biscayans. We found it in use over more than four hundred
    leagues (miles?) of our travel, without another in the whole
    extent.” The name thus given by the narrator of the Naufragios
    seemingly exists in these words, their definitions taken from a
    dictionary in MS. of the Pima language written by a missionary.
    No, <i>pima</i>: Nothing, <i>pim’ haitu</i>. Ques. What,
    <i>Ai?</i> Ans. <i>Pimahaitu</i> (nihil).</p>

    <h1>GRAMMAR OF THE HEVE LANGUAGE.</h1>

    <h2>PART I: ORTHOGRAPHY.</h2>

    <p>It has been thought proper to use nineteen characters in the
    language, among which are not included f, j, k, w, x, y, nor l,
    although the sound of l is somewhat heard in the soft
    enunciation given by the Indian to the letter r.</p>

    <p>The k is sufficiently supplied in the syllabic sounds que
    and qui, where the u is silent, although gue and gui are each
    of two syllables. There has been a disposition to omit the g
    also, the sound of which, as in go, if the natives had not
    originally, they certainly possess at present, got from the
    Spaniards. This should excuse its appearance here. The sound of
    z is strong as heard in <i>fits</i>.</p>

    <p>The vowels are sounded as in t<i>a</i>r, b<i>e</i>ar,
    s<i>i</i>lk, d<i>o</i>e, r<i>u</i>e.</p>

    <h2>PART II: ETYMOLOGY.</h2>

    <h3>SUBSTANTIVE.</h3>

    <p><i>Substantives</i> in this language are declined without
    the use of articles.</p>

    <p>2. Those which may be called <i>verbal</i>, from their
    origin in verbs, are much used: hiósguadauh, painting, or
    writing, is the passive (is painted) of the present active
    hiósguan, I paint. They have their times: hiósguadauh is in the
    present, expressing
    <!-- page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
       id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span> the picture I form now of the
       passive preterite hiósguacauh, the work I have executed, of
       which hiósguatzidaugh, the picture I will make, is the
       future passive: and when to these verbal substantives is
       added the particle gua, it denotes place, as, No
       hiósguadauhgua, the place where I paint, etc.</p>

    <h4>GUA.</h4>

    <p>3. But words signifying kindred, have their termination
    usually in gua also, for which <a href="#sect16">see section
    16</a>.</p>

    <h4>SIVEN, RINA.</h4>

    <p>4, 5. <i>Other verbal substantives</i>, signifying
    instruments, are made from the future active: thus, the verb
    métecan, I chop, having métetze in the future, receives siven
    in lieu of the final syllable, and makes the substantive,
    métesiven, axe or tool with which to chop. Many of these words
    likewise terminate in rina, as bícusirina, flute, from bícudan,
    I whistle, and bíhirina, shovel, from bihán, I scrape.</p>

    <h4>RAGUA, SURA.</h4>

    <p>6, 7. Many <i>abstract nouns</i> are formed by the addition
    of the particle ragua, as váde, joyously; váderagua, joy; déni,
    good; déniragua, goodness; dóhme, man, or people; dóhmeragua,
    humanity; and so diósragua, divinity. Others, substantive
    nouns, applied to certain places end in súra, as, omásúra,
    canebrake, from om, cane, and súra, in or among; huérigosúra,
    reedfield; húparosúra, mesquitscrub: and so a town is called
    Opósúra, because it is among some trees called opó, elm.</p>

    <p>8. The <i>verbs are substantives</i> likewise, and as such
    are declined as much so as the same words are conjugated when
    verbs: thus, nemútzan, I bewitch, is also wizard, and hiósguan,
    I write, is scrivener; but it is to be observed of these
    substantives, as well as of those which end in daugh, that they
    too have equally their times, as nemútzan, the wizard—that is
    now, in the present; nemútzari, the preterite that has;
    nemútzatze, the future that will, with the difference that
    these terminations are active, while those in daugh, etc., are
    passive.</p>

    <h3>ADJECTIVE NOUNS.</h3>

    <h4>TERI, EI, RAVE, E, I, O, U.</h4>

    <p id="sect12">9, 10, 11, 12. The many <i>adjective nouns</i>
    ending in téri, and ei, signify quality, as, bavitéri, elegant;
    aresumetéri, different or distinct; tasúquei, narrow; asóquei,
    thick; sútei, white; and so of the rest signifying color. Some
    ending in ráve, denote plenitude; for example, sitoráve, full
    of honey; composed of sitóri, honey, and ráve, full; seborráve,
    full of flies; ateráve of até, louse, etc.; others, ending in
    e, i, o, u, signify possession, as, esé, she that has
    petticoats; cúne, she that has a husband; guásue, he that has
    land for planting; húvi, the married man, from hub, woman;
    nóno, he that has a father, from nónogua, father, and sutúu, he
    that has finger-nails, from sutú: and they, moreover, have
    their times like verbs, since, from esé is formed esei,
    preterite, she that had petticoats; cúnetze, future, she that
    will marry, etc.; and afterwards they are declined as nouns,
    as, <i>Nom.</i>, eséi; <i>Gen.</i> eséigue. (For other form of
    the possessive, <a href="#sect18_19">see section 19</a>.)</p>
    <!-- page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>

    <h4>CA, SARI, SCOR, SGUARI.</h4>

    <p>13, 14. It is usual for the want of many positive
    affirmatives in the language to express by the positive of the
    opposite signification, adding the negation ca, as, nucuatéri,
    perishable; canucuatéri, everlasting; cúne, married, f.;
    cacúne, not married; húbi, married, m.; cahúbi, not married,
    etc. Those ending in sári, and scor, mark a bad, or vicious
    quality, as, dedensári, tobacco-smoker, from déinan, I suck;
    and hibesári, gluttonous, from hibáan, I eat; nehrisári,
    talker, from néhren, I talk; capasári, old rags, from capát;
    baníscor, weeper, from báanan; cotzíscor, sleeper, from cotzom;
    dióscor, vagabond, from dion, I walk, or vacosári, which has
    the same signification, from vácon. The termination, sguari, is
    used in this sense: dotzi, old man; dotzísguari, very old man;
    hóit, female of middle age; hoísguari, very old woman.</p>

    <h3>DECLENSION.</h3>

    <p>Substantives of the First Declension form their genitive in
    <i>que</i>, and usually are such as terminate in a vowel.</p>

    <p>Nónoguat, father, belongs to this declension, and forms the
    genitive nónauhte; but when preceded by a possessive pronoun,
    it loses the final guat, as has been stated, and the
    termination is left in <i>o</i>, to form the genitive in the
    first declension, as, no, my, no nónoque, of my father, which
    rule applies equally to other names of kindred.</p>

    <p>Sometimes an ablative is formed in <i>u</i>, as teópatu, in

    <h4>OF THE PLURAL.</h4>

    <p>15. Substantives, especially those animate of rational
    beings, usually form the
    <!--Page 13--><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
       id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span> plural by doubling the first
       syllable, as, dor, man, or male; dódor, men; hoit, woman,
       pl. hóhoit; déni, good, pl. dedéni.</p>

    <p>Some other words form their plural irregularly, as, doritzi,
    boy, pl. vus, applied to both sexes, though when intended only
    for males dódorus is used; hoquis, large girls, pl. hórquir;
    temátzi, big boy, pl. tetemtzi; to which when the particle
    <i>te</i> is added it marks the absence of any of the other
    sex, as dodórte, men only; hohóite, women only; hórquirte,
    girls only. The declension of these plurals is according to the
    rules before given.</p>

    <h3>OF KINDRED.</h3>

    <p id="sect16">16. The language is remarkable for another
    peculiarity, which is, that the females in many instances
    employ different words from the males: the father says to his
    son, Nognàt, to his daughter, Mórqua; the mother to either
    says, Nótzgua; the son to the father says, Nonógua,and the
    daughter says, Mósgua. The elder brother likewise is called
    Vátzgua, pl. Vapàtz, the younger Vángua, pl. Vopon, the elder
    sister Cotzgua, pl. Cocátz, the younger Víngua, pl. Vipim, to
    which adding the possessive pronouns no, amo, and the like, the
    gua is omitted to such as have that termination. There is much
    to be learned about the names of the kindred, but the subject
    is one too wide for present explanation.</p>

    <h3>PRONOUNS.</h3>

    <p>17. The <i>Personal Pronoun</i> nee, I, followed by another
    word becomes ne; nap, thou or you, becomes na, tamide becomes
    ta; emet or emíde becomes em, veride and iride become ver and
    ir; meride becomes mer.</p>

    its genitive améva, being declined like amet. Nee vasu,
    likewise means I myself.</p>

    but neither senéva nor améve are declined, only the pronouns

    <h4>GUAGUA, VUT.</h4>

    <p id="sect18_19">18, 19. <i>Possessive Pronouns</i> are the
    genitives of the primitive; thus, no vónama, means, my hat, no
    being the genitive of nee, and the same with the rest. But in
    order to say, this is mine, guagua is used applied to inanimate
    things, as, veride quit no guagua, this is my house; or vut
    applied to animate, as, veride cavadu no vut, this horse is
    mine; and with the change of person those genitives of the
    primitive must be added, as, no guagua, mine; amo guagua,
    thine, are guagua, his, &amp;c., no vut, mine, &amp;c. (Another
    manner of expressing the possessive has been given in
    <a href="#sect12">section 12</a>.)</p>

    <h4>INFINITIVE MOOD.</h4>

    <p>Although this mode does not exist in the language, still the
    natives have ways to express the thought, some of which are
    these:</p>

    <p>One mode is by the verb erám, I wish or think; so that to
    say, I wish to write, Nee hiósguavaerám may be used, which is
    the future hiósguatze, with the final syllable omitted for the
    particle va, and followed by the erám. In the same manner,
    other verbs may be proceeded with, they remaining stable
    through all the mutations that erám undergoes, as in the
    following:</p>

    <h3>ACTIVE VOICE.</h3>

    <h4>INDICATIVE MOOD.</h4>

    <table summary=""
           align="center">
        <tr>
            <td><i>Present</i>, Erám, I wish.</td>

            <td><i>Pluperfect</i>, Ehritu, I had wished.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><i>Imperfect</i>, Eramtu, I wished.</td>

            <td><i>Future</i>, Erátze, I shall wish.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><i>Perfect</i>, Ehri, I have wished.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td colspan="2">SUBJUNCTIVE, (Impt?) Erátzern, I might
            wish, etc.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>In the passive erám is not used, but naquém, which also
    means, I wish, and with the preterite particle, in the manner
    that is stated in the fourth form of the imperative, the
    infinitive mood in this voice is expressed, as, Nee no
    hiósguarico naquém, I desire to be written.</p>

    <p>Another mode that serves for the Infinitive, is that after a
    verb of motion, the future of the verb is used, as to express,
    I come to you to say, Nee eme queitudetze güerem: here, Nee is
    I; eme, to you; güerem, or üerem, I come, and queitudetze the
    future of the verb queituden, I say, or make known.</p>

    <h4>GERUNDS.</h4>

    <p>The gerund in <i>di</i> is found in the expression: Already
    arrived the time of labor; for which, taking the preterite
    pánauhri, the verb pánauan signifying labor, add dagua, time,
    and for arrived use hassíde, the preterite of hássem, followed
    by the de, particle, signifying already, and the phrase is
    formed pánauhridagua hasside.</p>

    <p>The gerund in <i>do</i> is found in the phrase Vus hóquedo
    panavame, the boys playing, work, in which vus is boys, hóquedo
    or hóqueco, the gerund of hoquen, play, and panavame, the
    plural of pánavan, work. The passive voice has likewise the
    gerund, as for example: Nap sícriuhdo cotzóm, Whilst thou art
    shorn, sleepest; here nap cotzóm is, you sleep, sícriuhdo is
    the gerund in do passive of the verb sicán, and toasquilo,
    hair.</p>

    <p>The gerund in <i>dum</i>, and supine joined to a verb of
    motion is equivalent to the future as before stated in the
    second mode of the infinitive; but should there be no verb of
    movement with the gerund in dum, the particle betzéuai, for, is
    used, as <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"
       id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span> this suffices for payment,
       (hoc ad solvendum sufficit,) Veride hasem ovíde betzéguai;
       veride meaning this, hasem, suffices; ovide betzévai, for
       payment; ovíden signifying pay.</p>

    <p>Thus much it has been found necessary to say of the verb in
    its active and passive voice, of its modes and times, which
    will serve as a paradigm for the conjugation of any verb
    observant of the form of its preterite and future (the roots
    whence rise the other tenses) to be discovered in the
    vocabulary.</p>

    <h4>FREQUENTATIVE VERB.</h4>

    <p>21. This verb signifies the frequent repetition of the same
    action, and is formed by adding the adverb tátze, peace-meal,
    as, I write often, tátze ne hiósgan.</p>

    <h4>COMPULSIVE VERB.</h4>

    <p>22. It is thus called because it signifies to cause or
    compel to do any thing, and is formed by taking away the last
    syllable of any verb and replacing it with tudem or tuden,
    which alone is conjugated, and has the perfect tudari, and
    future tudetze, as varuhtúden, I cause to sin; verúhtze being
    the future of varúuen.</p>

    <h4>APPLICATIVE VERB.</h4>

    <p>23. When the action is for, by, or through, (“para ó por,”)
    this verb is used, having its termination in dem or den,
    perfect, deri, and future, detze; as pánauan, work; whence is
    formed pánauiden, which is the applicative, so that to say, I
    work for you, the phrase is Nee eme pánauiden; and the mother
    to express, My son has failed me, (died), says, No nótzi
    múquideri; although in the place of this applicative the
    preposition betzéguai, for, is used likewise, or de, by; as,
    Christ died for us, Cristo tamo betzéguai, or tamóde múqui.</p>

    <h4>CONTINUATIVE VERB.</h4>

    <p>24. This verb serves to continue the action, and is made
    from the future, omitting the tze and substituting sem or sen,
    as nenérsem, I am continually talking, from nehren, I speak;
    the future, nenértze; biquesen, I am thus singing, from biquen,
    I sing; future, bequetze, for which there appearing to be no
    perfect, the imperfect, bíquesenru may be used, and the same is
    the case with the words that end in hon, as merihon, go
    running; nenerhon, be speaking; biquehon, be singing, of which
    the future termination is sintze, as nenérsintze.</p>

    <h4>COMPLETIVE VERB.</h4>

    <p>25. This gives completeness to the signification of the word
    out of which it is made so full that nothing remains further,
    and is formed of the future taking away the final tze, and
    placing suam instead, as, baán, I eat; bétze, I will eat;
    besuam, I eat until I have finished it all; todam, I leave;
    todetz, I will leave; todesuam, I leave forever,—at once. The
    penitent may say, Oquine haóna no cananacemca todesuatze, Now,
    forevermore, I will leave my sins; the perfect being formed in
    coari, and the future in uatze.</p>

    <h4>ESTIMATIVE VERB.</h4>

    <p>26. This denotes the judgment that one forms of anything,
    as, dénitzem, I judge it good; déni meaning good; hana Diosi
    denitzem, perhaps you esteem God? nee
    <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span> eme deosaritzem, I judge you
       happy; deosari meaning happy; nee eme náventzem, I consider
       you poor—pity you; náven meaning poor: and they form the
       perfect, tziui, and future tziúhtze.</p>

    <h4>CONVERSIVE VERB.</h4>

    <p>27. When a thing changes so as to pass from one to another
    form or quality, this verb is used. Earth, tevat; genitive,
    teuhte; accusative, teuhta, whence comes the verb teúhtuun, I
    make me earth,—as do the sticks become, and bodies that rot. So
    dóhmetum, make man, explains the mystery of the incarnation,
    as, God the Son made himself man for us, Dios noquát tamóde, or
    tamo, betzeguai dóhmetui. So batuum, is made water, bat, water;
    nasórtaan, I throw away; nasórtuun, is thrown away, to become
    corruption; of which the perfect is tui, the future, tutze.</p>

    <p>28. There are some <i>Compound Verbs</i> which end in donon,
    signifying to go to do something, which appear to be formed
    from the future, omitting the last syllable tze, and
    substituting donon, as amúdonon, I go to hunt; amún being, I
    hunt; the future amútze ; cumándonon, I go to gather wood, from
    cumánan, I gather wood, future cumantze; baudónon, I go to
    bring water, formed of bat, water; vun, the future of vtze,
    bring, and donon, which has the perfect doni, and future
    dontze.</p>

    <p>29. The termination guan, is usually a sign of the <i>Active
    Verb</i>, as in mótzguan, I begin: máguan, or máhuan, I plough,
    and is added by the natives to some Spanish words they use,
    such are perdonároguan, I pardon; ayunároguan, I fast;
    velároguan, I watch. Some form the perfect in guari, and future
    in guatze; others the perfect in uhri, and future in úhtze,
    úitze, or in guatze.</p>

    <p>30. To form <i>Compound Neuter Verbs</i>, the verb dáan, I
    go, is frequently used, as bahútunan, I melt (active);
    bahútudaan, I melt, or am melting, the neuter, barínan, I
    soften; baricdaan, I go on to soften; zicónan, I break;
    zicócdaan, I break (neuter); the perfect being dai, the future,
    détze.</p>

    <p>31. <i>Other Neuters</i> are formed of active verbs ending
    in an by changing it into en, as sebán, I freeze; seben,
    freeze; basán, I ripen; basen, ripen; sepán, cool; sepen, cool;
    nacuan, hurt; nacuen, hurt. To form the perfect, the en is
    changed into i; but the future, although it always ends in tze,
    differs, as will appear by the vocabulary.</p>

    <p>32. In the same manner as of Active Verbs in an, <i>Neuter
    Verbs</i> in en are made, so from other actives in an, neuters
    are made in un, as, busán, I awake another; busún, I awake me;
    tutzan, I quench; tucún, I quench me, in the perfect changing
    the un to i, and the future to tze.</p>

    <h4>PLURAL OF VERBS.</h4>

    <p id="sect33">33. This language has the notable peculiarity of
    the verbs oftentimes differing greatly in the plural from the
    singular, as, vaquén, enter one; múume, enter many; vóon, one
    to lay down; medáguame, lay down many; méran, one to run;
    vóome, many to run; batémucun, to drown oneself; betécoome,
    many to drown themselves; batemean, drown one; batecódan, drown
    many.</p>

    <p>34. There are many <i>Compound Active Verbs</i> ending in
    puguan or puuan, which signify to pluck, as beguát, skin,
    genitive; beúhte, accusative; beúhta, whence beuhpuuan, tear
    off the skin is formed, and from mo, hair of the human head
    comes mópuuan, pluck the hair, etc.; sequát, flower, genitive,
    seúhte; accusative, seúhta
    <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"
       id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span> gives seúhpuuan, to pluck
       flowers; nágua; root, genitive, naúhte; accusative, naúhta,
       when naúhpuuan, eradicate, is formed, their perfect being in
       uhri, their future in natze.</p>

    <h4>ZEM, ZEN.</h4>

    <p>35. Estimative Verbs it has already been said end in tzem,
    but there are other verbs of that termination that signify
    certain passion, failing, or quality, as, hisumtzem, I am
    hungry; veráctzem, I am thirsty ; vrútzen, I am hot; vtétzen, I
    am cold, which form their perfects in tziui, the futures in
    tzíuhtze.</p>

    <h4>TAAN.</h4>

    <p id="sect36">36. <i>The Particle</i> taan compounded with a
    substantive, signifies to do, as, sibúrtaan, to make girdles
    composed of sibúra, band; zántaan, to make arrows, zamát
    signifying arrow; vacotaan, to make bow, from vácotzi, that
    instrument; but when it is component of the verb it signifies,
    I say that I wish, thus from nósquen, I return, nósquitaan is
    made, signifying, I say that I wish to return, and from
    pánauan, labor, is pánauataan, I say that I wish to labor.</p>

    <h4>ENI, MANI, HABI,</h4>

    <p>Being the English substantive verb AM.</p>

    <p>37. Such is the condition of this part of speech: yonder is
    a man, anát sei dor <i>eni</i>, and if he live there, or is
    there standing, anát catzí, etc., which catzí is used only for
    persons. Yonder is water, anát, or aguát bat <i>maní</i>,
    yonder is grass, anát dósa <i>habí</i>, and also may be said,
    bat eni, dosa eni, but bat habí, dosa mani would not be
    correct. Further than this the substantive verb am appears not
    to show itself clearly: thus that utterance of God, I am that I
    am, has no corresponding words in the tongue : it could
    seemingly be made somewhat intelligible in this wise: Nee uehva
    nee, which word for word means, I greatly I, and am is not
    expressed though understood. So in asking, Who is it, the
    answer is, Nee, and not I with the verb. This method of
    speaking should be regarded: to say the house of Pedro was my
    house, it should be, Pevroque qui no quiru, of which qui means
    house, and Pevroque qui, house of Pedro. The verb was, does not
    now exist in it apart, but in expression it appears, or nearly
    so, in the substantive qui, which is put in the imperfect by
    the termination of that tense, ru being added, as, quiru, was
    house; no quiru, was my house. The same is otherwise said:
    Pevroque qui no guaguaru, the house of Pedro was mine; the
    guagua, if alone, signifies, is mine.</p>

    <h4>MAGUAN.</h4>

    <p>38. There are several <i>Compound Verbs</i> that end in
    maguan, which signify, to throw something to another, as,
    ermaguan, to throw blood (erát) on him; dósmaguan, to throw
    grass (dosát) on him; teúhmaguan, to throw dirt (tevát) on him;
    sitórimaguan, to throw honey (sitóri) on him, which form the
    perfect in guari, the future in guatze.</p>

    <h4>TADEN.</h4>

    <p>39. The <i>Particle</i> táden, the terminal of several
    verbs, expresses the like or dislike the good or evil
    appearance of anything according to the name or adverb to which
    it is joined, as, neve sodóta nanactáden, or hidenatóden, I do
    not like this bower; tamide naven tamo tademe, we find
    ourselves poor; nee deosári no taden, I find myself fortunate,
    the perfect being found in taderi, the future in tadetze.</p>
    <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
       id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>

    <h4>MUCUN.</h4>

    <p>40. Of the Verb <i>Mucún</i>, I die, compounds such as these
    are made: vrumucún, I die of heat; vrúcóome, they die of heat;
    hisú-mucún, I die of hunger; hisúmcóome, they die of hunger;
    varótmucún, I die of thirst; varó-coóme, they die of thirst;
    cúmemucún, I die of envy; cumecoáme, they die of envy. Vrútzen
    is, I have heat; hisúmtzen, I have hunger; veráctzen, I have
    thirst; cúmen, I have envy. The reason of changing mucún to
    form the plural may be seen in <a href="#sect36">section
    36</a>.</p>

    <h4>NEOQUEN.</h4>

    <p>41. Neóquen, means I command, and observe this method as
    respects its use: Nee uneóquen, and I command to bring; nee
    nerta neóquen, and I command, to pray; nee ouit neóquen, and I
    command to call. Vtze is the future of vun, I bring; nertátze,
    I pray, the future of nértaan: ouictze the future of ouican, I
    call; so that the tze is taken from the future, and neóquen is
    placed in its stead. Notice, likewise, this method: Nap ca
    istutándauh, It is commanded not to lie.</p>

    <p>So far of the verbs, which as well other parts of speech all
    the Indians use with nicety and elegance. For their
    conjugation, a single exemplar has been given; but their
    perfects and futures being differently formed, which are the
    roots whence the other tenses spring, they have been placed in
    the vocabulary added to the verbs, a knowledge of which will
    suffice to form all the other times.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>PARTICIPLE.</h3>

    <p>42. The verbs become participles without undergoing change
    of form, as, hiósguam, I write, or he that writes, is the
    present participle; hiósguari, I have written, or he that has
    written; hiósguatze, I will write, or he that will, is the
    preterite (future?) participle. The same in its proportion is
    to be understood of the passive voice.</p>

    <p>The <i>Present Participle</i> is of the second declension,
    forming the genitive in te, thus Nominative, hiósguan;
    Genitive, hiósgnante, etc. The imperfect participle is of the
    same declension, with the difference that the mark of the
    imperfect, ru, is the final, as, Nom. hiósguamru, Gen.
    hiósguamteru, etc.</p>

    <p>The <i>Perfect Participle</i> is of the first declension,
    having its genitive in que, as, Nom. hiósguari, Gen.
    hiósguarique.</p>

    <p><i>Pluperfect Participle</i> is declined like the perfect,
    observing what has been said of the imperfect, as, Nom.
    hiósguariru, Gen. hiósguariqueru, etc.</p>

    <p>The <i>Future Participle</i> belongs to the second
    declension, the genitive ending in te, preceded by n or m, as,
    Nom. hiósguatze, Gen. hiósguatzente.</p>

    <p>The plural, it appears, should be declined in the same
    manner as the singular in respect of its termination in te or
    que.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>PREPOSITION.</h3>

    <p>43. The prepositions that govern the genitive might with
    reason be called post-positions, since they follow the case;
    for Pedro Pedroque betzégnai, with you amó ma.</p>

    <h3>ADVERB.</h3>

    <p>The adverbs are very many, and by them more especially is
    expressed the manner of walking, of sitting, of sounding, etc.,
    and oftentimes the enunciation copies after the sense, as,
    cúusan, I sound; catzcatze cúusan, clattering sound.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>INTERJECTION.</h3>

    <p>45. Some of the interjections are these: Ari! and when
    repeated ari, ari! are those of one feeling pain; Asioma is of
    one that menaces, like, You will see! and Asma is like, I
    desire to see! Hábesa matzi, Well, then! Ahéne is exclaimed by
    one who recollects himself; Navehtzemne, Alas! Woe to me!</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>CONJUNCTION.</h3>

    <p>46. The conjunctions to the extent they can, will be treated
    of separately; for although the language of Indians is exact,
    there are difficulties to be encountered, and from those not
    brought up in their use, requiring special study.</p>

    <p>47. The word <i>And</i> is represented by aui, as, Nee aui
    nap, I and you, and also by vai placed afterward used in this
    way, Nee nap vai.</p>

    <p>48. Whether the sentence consist of one or of two parts,
    this conjunction If is nowhere found, but the gerund in do or
    co is used; and in this manner should it be of a single part or
    an individual: If I do it well, I shall be content, hidénane
    éndo, or énco, nanacerátze; when of two, thus: If I did it
    well, you will be content, hidéna netzendo, or emco, nap
    nanacerátze: whence it may be seen that in the first passage is
    put the nominative nee, having but one part, and in the second
    the dative or accusative netz, since another member comes in
    which is nap, you. These are other examples: If I should be
    well, I will go to see you, Nee hidéna crádo, osét eme
    teuhdontze, which is an expression of one proposition, for
    though two persons enter there the action is single: If I shall
    have worked well you will pay me, Nee hidéna pananhriuhco, nap
    netz ovidetze, which is of two positions, the action being of
    two.</p>

    <p>49. In the examples about to be given, it will be observed
    that <i>That</i> is never used, whether it correspond to the
    quod or the ut of the Latin. Nee eme vitzán, nap hibe, I see
    that you are lax; Nee aguáteran, Domincotze amo misa ea
    vitzaca, I know that you have not heard mass Sunday; where
    vitzaca or vitzácauh is passive perfect, and the literal
    rendering is, I know, on Sunday your mass was not heard. I
    desire that you may live here, Nee eme iuide cáteo naquém, in
    which cáteo is an active perfect participle, and the verb
    naquém, I desire, ever requires this construction. The verb
    óqueem, I command, is peculiar likewise in one respect: in
    order to say I command you that you work, Nee eme panaúaoqueem
    is said; panaúaoqueem being composed of two words, of which
    panauatze, I will work, is from panaúan, work, the tze final
    being taken away and substituted by óqueem.</p>

    <p>50. The equivalent of <i>Because</i>, nanévari, can be thus
    shown. I become angry because you are lax, Nee zínauan, ne
    néuari nap híbeen: with the particle aréde, which means
    because, it may be elegantly expressed, Nap híbeen, aredene
    zinauan, which, word for word, is, You are lax, for that I
    become angry. Here are other
    <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
       id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> instances: Because I am sick
       I do not work, Nee ca panauan, nanéuarine cocotzem; in
       another manner, Nee cocotzem, arédene ca panauan, or Nee no
       cócotzihdade ca panauan, which corresponds to this, I,
       because of my infirmity, do not work. I come, because you
       called me, Nee eue hasi, naneuari nap netz ouíqui. Eue,
       signifying hither, is used because to the Indian ear, I came
       hither, is more euphonious than only I came. Nap netzoúiqui,
       arédene hási, I am glad, because you come to see me, Nee
       nánaceran, nanéuari nap netzeue teúhdóniueren, or otherwise,
       Nap netz eue teúhdóniueren arédene nanaceran.</p>

    <p>51. The equivalent of <i>Before</i> is caque, the
    translation of which is not yet. Before you could come I was
    already here, Nap caque hasdo nee vínu iuide énitude, of which
    hasdo is the gerund of hásem, that part of speech being thus
    used with caque, when it signifies before, and is literally,
    You not arrived yet, already was I here. Another instance:
    Before you can go, you will pay me: Caquena dado, netz
    ovidetze; also, Before the wheat could be planted, it rained:
    Perilon caque étzih dauh, duqui.</p>

    <p>52. <i>After</i> is rendered likewise by the gerunds with
    the adverb vaar, after. After he had sinned, he was converted
    to God: Varúhruco vaàr, Diosse vené are viranari, that is,
    having sinned afterward, etc.; and also it may be without vaár,
    as, After it had rained much, the river carried away the earth:
    Muic duco, bata guasta údari. Again: After the wheat had been
    cut, it got wet, and was lost: Pericon are tepúnaricoua
    sánhruco nasórtui.</p>

    <p>53. <i>When</i> may be rendered by héco, as, When you had
    come to see me, I had gone for wood: Hècona netz eue teuhdòni,
    nee cumandóniru. Another: When Christ had died, so much as was
    man died, and had not died so much as was God: Héco múcruco
    Cristo, are dóremcade muqui, are Diósemeade ca muqui; where
    also mucruco is gerund, and likewise may be said, héco muqui
    Cristo etc. If the question be asked, When? the accent is
    placed upon the last letter.</p>

    <h4>NUMERALS.</h4>

    <p>54, 55, 57. The native having counted to ten, says ten and
    one on it, etc., and at twenty says one man, sei dóhme, for the
    reason of that being his full number of fingers and toes: for
    forty he says, two men, got dóhme, and so on to a hundred,
    marqui dóhme. After twenty the count is the same as with the
    ten, twenty and one on it, etc. These numerals have also their
    inflections:</p>

        <p>The title of the work, in manuscript, from which the
        grammatical notices have been elaborated is Arte y
        Vocabulario de la lingua Dohema, Heve ó Eudeva; the
        adjective termination of the last and first name being
        evidently Spanish, as is also the plural terminations used
        elsewhere in some of the modifications of those words. We
        have only the definition of Heve with certainty given as “
        people;” to the word “nation” in the vocabulary, there
        being attached the remark: “I find no generic term: each
        (nation) has its specific name; the Eudeves are called
        Dóhme.” Another like work, also unpublished, with the title
        <i>Arte cíe In lengua Pinea</i> has the dictionary
        inscribed <i>Vocabulario en lengua Nevome</i>.</p>

        <p>In the uncertain relationship of the tribes to each
        other, better marked and measured perhaps by the proximity
        of their idioms than by any other means with which we are
        acquainted, a thought has been taken from the indistinct
        manner in which these different people are spoken of by
        those who have been among them to advance in the present
        title, (since we may not be at liberty to reject,) the word
        Dóhme for the family; and Pima generally for the common
        language, under which the Opata, Heve, Nevome, Sobahipurls
        and the rest may be placed, as they shall become known,
        each by its separate dialect.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
